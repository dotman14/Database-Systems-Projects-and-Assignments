##College Tutor: Project Phase 2

Use the EER diagram provided by your instructor (hard copy, given in class) as the formal requirement specification of this project and convert it into a relational schema diagram using the mapping steps explained in class.

<h2>Your task:</h2>

- Design relations (tables). Each relation (table) should contain the following information: name, attributes, and, primary key.
- Each attribute should have appropriate data type.
- Foreign keys must be specified if there are any.
- Referential integrity constraints must be specified if there are any.

<h2>Using Oracle Data Modeler:</h2>

- You must use Oracle Data modeler to create a relational model (Note here: not logical model).
- Export your model to DDL file (say project.sql). If you see any errors in the DDL file, fix the model and generate new sql code until no errors are left.
